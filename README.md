## Smoking score estimation

## Data

Participants comprised **289** Caucasian individuals of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP) in Munich. Of the participants, 

+ 93 women and 196 men
+ 129 (81 men, 48 women) were treated for major dipressive disorders (MDD)
+ 160 (115 men, 45 women) were healthy controls with no history of a depressive disorder. 

Baseline whole blood samples were obtained at 6 pm after two hours of fasting and abstention from coffee and physical activity. Subjects then received 1.5 mg oral dexamethasone, and a second blood draw was performed at 9 pm, three hours after dexamethasone ingestion.

## Methodology

The smoking score was calculated using 187 smoking-associated CpGs identified in an EWAS published by Zeilinger et al. and the R package EpiSmokEr. The filtered and normalised beta values were used.
